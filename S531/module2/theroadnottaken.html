    <h2>By Robert Frost</h2>

    <!-- Main Poem Section -->
    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
    And sorry I could not travel both<br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
    And looked down one as far as I could<br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
        
    <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
    And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
    Though as for that the passing there<br>
    Had worn them really about the same,</p>
        
    <p>And both that morning equally lay<br>
    In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
    Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
    I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
